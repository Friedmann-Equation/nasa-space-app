    "This Voice User Interface (VUI) website designed for inclusivity friendly, especially those with visual impairment . It summarizes The History of Universe, presenting 36 images and sonification captured by The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of NASA, which is a space telescope designed to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets. Let's travel back through the space and time with James Webb Space Telescope!",
